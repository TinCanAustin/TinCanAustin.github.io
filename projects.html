                    <p class="disc">The "Save Water App" was developed as a part of the 'Hold That Drop' Initiative my Abu Dhabi Indian School Al-Muroor.  I was one of the initial lead developers of this app, working alongside another student on my team. The app tracks students' water usage and provides suggestions on how they can optimize their consumption. The app is currently of the play store for further development by the current team.</p>

                    <p class="disc" style="width: 48vw;">Pet Migu is a desktop app built with Python that places a small Miku on your screen while you work, play games, or do nothing. It was a fun side project I created for time-pass while working at 8px.</p>
