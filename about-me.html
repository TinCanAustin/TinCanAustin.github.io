                        <p>My name is Austin and I'm currently a second-year student at Simon Fraser University studying Computer Science. Initially, I was taking Sound to but it got to hectic over CS TwT. I love programming and it has been a long time passion of mine since a kid, but like most kids I did procrastinate a lot. Thatâ€™s the reason why I took CS, and I dont regret it (kinda).</p>
                        <p>In my free time, you'll catch me reading comics, playing games or making music. You may even catch me wandering around outside randomly sometimes with no real aim on where I want to go. I also love collecting plushies, figures and Album CDs (Particularly of <a href="">HATSUNE MIKUUU</a>)</p>
