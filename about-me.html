                        <p>So you want to know about me huh??? Well your at the right page UwU.</p>
                        <p>My name is Austin and I'm currently a second-year student at Simon Fraser University studying Computer Science. Initially, I was taking Sound to but it got to hectic over CS TwT. I love programming and it has been a long time passion of mine since a kid, but like most kids I did procrastinate a lot. Thatâ€™s the reason why I took CS, and I dont regret it (kinda).</p>
                        <p>In my free time, you'll catch me reading comics, playing games or making music. You may even catch me wandering around outside randomly sometimes with no real aim on where I want to go. I also love collecting plushies, figures and Album CDs (Particularly of <a href="">HATSUNE MIKUUU</a>)</p>

                    <li>My coerce load this semester is also quite heavy so you may find me in the libraries during the weekends studying.</li>

                    <li>As a student, all I can do right now is study and make projects. Maybe even apply for internships here and there. </li>
                    <li>I am also want to focus more on music production cause I'm really enjoying it as of now. Maybe take more sound courses and get good at this.</li>
                    <li>Going forward, I also want to make a lot more project, be it big or small. Does not matter. I have fun coding</li>
