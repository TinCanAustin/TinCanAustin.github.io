                        <p>If you want to know me, you are on the right page.</p>
                        <p>My name is Austin, and I'm a second-year student at Simon Fraser University studying Computer Science. Initially, I was taking Sound too, but it got too hectic with CS TwT. I love programming, and it has been a long-time passion of mine since I was a kid, but like most kids, I procrastinated a lot. That's why I took CS, and I don't regret it (kinda).</p>
                        <p>You'll catch me reading comics, playing games, or making music in my free time. You may even catch me wandering around outside randomly sometimes with no real aim on where I want to go. I also love collecting plushies, figures, and Album CDs (Particularly of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNf3GPizM58">HATSUNE MIKUUU</a>)</p>

                <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently trying to do as many projects as I possibly can. Why not? (I wanna populate my portfolio a bit).</li>
                    <li>I'm also focusing on music production since it's my other passion.</li>
                    <li>My cource load this semester is also quite heavy, so you may find me studying in the libraries during the weekends.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What do I plan on doing ahead?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> As a student, I can only study and make projects right now. Maybe even apply for internships here and there.</li>
                    <li>I also want to focus more on music production cause I'm really enjoying it. I will probably take more sound courses and get good at this.</li>
                    <li>Going Forward, I also want to make many more projects with others, big or small. Does not matter. I have to learn collaboration and overall I have fun coding.</li>
